# File Transfer

There are many situations when transferring files either to or from a target system is necessary. We may successfully exploit a web application vulnerability, achieve RCE on a target web server, or even upload a web shell. There are many ways that we could upgrade our access to an interactive shell, and some require successfully transferring scripts, binaries, or tools to the target. During an internal assessment, we may find ourselves on a Windows host with a need to transfer over tools to perform enumeration of the Active Directory environment, to attempt privilege escalation, or have the need to download command output for offline processing.
